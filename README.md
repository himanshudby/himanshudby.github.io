Step 1: Upload your Blog Content.


Write your blog post in a text editor and save it as a Markdown file (e.g., my-new-post.md).


Go to your GitHub repository.

Click Add file > Upload files.

Upload your .md file (it helps to keep them organized, e.g., in a posts folder, but anywhere is fine).

Crucial Step: Once uploaded, click on the file in GitHub, then click the Raw button (top right of the file view). Copy that URL from your browser address bar.

Step 2: Update the Code

I have updated constants.ts below to include a ready-to-use template. You just need to copy-paste the template block inside the blogPosts array and fill in your details.
